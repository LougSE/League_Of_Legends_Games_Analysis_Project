# League of Legends (LoL) 50,000 Ranked Games Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of **50,000 ranked League of Legends (LoL) games** from the EUW region. The dataset provides a comprehensive look at various in-game factors such as team composition, key objectives, and game outcomes. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns that influence match outcomes and to explore potential models for predicting game results based on these factors.

## Motivation
League of Legends is a popular team-based strategy game, and understanding what contributes to winning or losing a match is critical for both casual and professional players. This project aims to:
- Analyze **50,000 ranked games** to identify the most impactful game factors.
- Build predictive models that can forecast match outcomes.
- Provide insights that can inform both players and game designers.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this analysis includes over **50,000 ranked EUW games** and provides fields for:
- **Game ID**: Unique identifier for each game.
- **Creation Time**: Timestamp of when the game was created.
- **Game Duration**: The length of the game in seconds.
- **Season ID**: Identifies the season of the match.
- **Match Outcome**: Indicates the winner (1 = team1, 2 = team2).
- **In-Game Events**: First Baron, dragon, tower, blood, inhibitor, and Rift Herald (1 = team1, 2 = team2, 0 = none).
- **Team Composition**: Champions and summoner spells for each team, using Riot's champion and summoner spell IDs.
- **Objective Control**: The number of towers, inhibitors, Baron, dragon, and Rift Herald kills for each team.
- **Champion Bans**: The five champions banned by each team.

The dataset was collected via the Riot Games API, and usernames were scraped from 3rd party LoL sites to gather match data.
